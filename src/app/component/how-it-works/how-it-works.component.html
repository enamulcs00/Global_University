                Univ Globalâ€™s innovative technology may seem like magic, but there is a lot going on behind the scenes
                to ensure that every user gets the best possible result when uploading their application supporting
                documents to our automated portal. We aim to make it as easy as possible for our users throughout the
                journey of course search and matching; applying to the programmes and universities that closely align
                with their interests. We help representatives and students accomplish this in just a matter of clicks
                with our automated technology.

            </p>
            <p>
                When an application along with supporting documents are uploaded to our portal, our engines get to work
                analysing your documents before matching the documents against the entry criteria of partner
                universities in different countries. Our algorithms look at the application and submitted documents and
                break down analysis based on Academic entry requirements, English language requirements and Work
                experiences etc.(if required)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Academic requirements: </strong> On the Academic requirement side of things, we analyse
                everything from our in-built portal to make sure the match making is completed based on the partner
                universities offerings. These factors help us understand and determine whether the applicant meets the
                Academic criteria set by our partner universities.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> English language requirements:</strong> On the English language requirements, our dynamic
                automated portal detects different types of English language requirement documents uploaded on our
                portal, analyses the requirements and determines how each English language requirement will best match
                together with the criteria set by our partner universities.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Work Experience: </strong> On the work experience/ portfolio requirements for selected courses,
                our cutting-edge technology can understand your main work experience roles and responsibilities and
                based on the information it is paired with requirements set by partner universities.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Post applying:</strong> Once we offer matching universities, a user can select the universities
                to which they can apply, and the application is submitted with a simple click of button. The next stages
                are the most engaging and interesting where our partner universities will be processing the applications
                to make offers to applicants. Our technology makes it easier for partner institutions to integrate the
                application and supporting documents onto their systems which will help them process the applications
                within their standard processing time frames before notifying the representative / applicant. Our
                automated technology not only helps representatives / applicants in a unique, eye-catching way of
                applying, but also ensures that the process is much simpler for partner institutions and our goal is to
                make sure the entire process is simplified in a convenient fashion.
